Proposal

I am going to make an event planner for the restaurant "Plaj."
My plan to have two levels of authorization. One for the user and another for an
admin to change menu items and such.

I plan to have a calendar that shows available dates to users as well as forms
where the user can populate fields for details of their event and to request a quote.

Its useful because the current event planning infrastructure at "Plaj" is all
currently ran on a single google docs form and I want to make something easier
for them to use.
